Experimenting with a bash-completion support
for reading from the clipboard history

Goal is to add a keybinding for sorting
through the clipboard history and insert
it in place. 

Ideally, this would work similar to
"ctrl-r" style history completion, except
checking the clipboard history. 

However, at the moment, there is no support
for custom history style commands, so
we add a hook for using "menu-complete"
which is reasonably close. 

The inputrc binds this to ctrl-l. 

Menu style completion (menu-complete)
seems to work much better for this than
the default "complete" style completion,
so we try to use that. A wrinkle there
is that bash does not currently support
specifing the completion type on...

At the moment, it only works with the history
file from the "clipbored" clipboard history
app (https://github.com/trapd00r/clipbored).
Mostly that is because it was the easiest
format to parse. Support for others
(parcellite, gclipper, klipper, etc) could
be added.

To use: add contents of inputrc to your
.inputc and reload (cltr-x ctrl-r). Then
`source clipboard_completions.sh`.

"ctrl-l" on an empty line should insert
the last entry from the "clipbored" history
file. Hitting it again will cycle though
the history.
